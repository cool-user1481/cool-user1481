## Hi there 👋
I'm a vanilla client-side web programmer, whith experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including ES6 through ES11! 
<!--I  started learning js about 9 years after ES6 was common :p-->
### Abount/projects
I enjoy video games such as [cuberealm](https://cuberealm.io/#survival-us-1), and have written many of the most popular [scirpts for cuberealm](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/1496792-cooluser1481), and a [bot](https://github.com/cool-user1481/cuberealm-chatbot)! I love video games, but games with ideas I had for a game that would be perfect for me did not exist :(. Therefore, I started work on [my own simple javascript game engine (GTE)](https://github.com/cool-user1481/GTE-Tile-Engine/blob/main/engine.js), and I am making multiple [games](https://github.com/cool-user1481/GTE-Tile-Engine/blob/main/games) with it! I plan to learn more languages and libraies soon, including node.js, three.js, typescript, next.js or svelte, godot/GDscript, and C++, as I am still somewhat young (also why I am bad at programming).
### What I love
